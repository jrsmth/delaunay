# Question :: Why about writing your own MAKE script that can be called locally (for MAJOR/MINOR) and from GH (for PATCH)
# Steps :: drop snapshot, tag, bump version, append snapshot, commit
# Could turn this into your own github action (npm-package-bump)? Muntjac it... Probs worth a couple of weeks of Spring...
